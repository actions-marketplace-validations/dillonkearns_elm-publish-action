# elm-publish-action

Publishes elm releases if you're on the master branch and
the elm.json version is unpublished. It will automatically
create a tag in github and run publish.

This is nice because you can make sure your CI is passing before
the finalizing the git tag and Elm package release.

Note: this action will entirely skip publishing if you haven't yet published a release.

So you'll need to do the first release manually. Otherwise there would be a risk of accidentally
pushing version 1.0.0 before you're ready to publish.

This action only publishes on the master branch. So a good workflow is to change versions on a branch, and
then once you merge that branch the new release will happen as soon as your CI finishes. Or if your CI fails,
you'll get a chance to fix it before the release goes out.
